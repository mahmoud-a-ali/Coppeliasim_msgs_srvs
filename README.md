# coppeliasim_msgs_srvs
This package is an update of the [vrep_common] package -by [Jonathan Cacace][]- which contains the definitation of the required msgs and srvs that enable ros to communicate with the coppeliasim simulator. this package is one of 5 ros packages to have a fully ros-integration of Coppeliasim.

For more information about these services/messages and how it can be used to communicate with Coppeliasim, you can check the [coppeliasim_APIs][] page.

### Building 

The following instructions assume that a catkin workspace has been created at `$HOME/catkin_ws` and Coppeliasim directory is placed at the Home directory `$HOME/CoppeliaSim`. you always can update the paths based on your machine setup.

```bash
# change to the src directory in your Catkin workspace
cd $HOME/catkin_ws/src

# Clone Coppeliasim_ros_control pkg 
git clone https://github.com/mahmoud-a-ali/Coppeliasim_msgs_srvs

# change to the main Catkin workspace
cd ..

# build the workspace (using catkin_tools)
 catkin build
 
 # activate your workspace
 source $HOME/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```
This package does not generate any excutables, only header files for different messages and services will be generated.

### Usage & Example
Refer to [ur5_coppeliasim_roscontrol][] package on how you can use the messages and services generated by the Coppeliasim_msgs_srvs package to communicate with coppeliasim and control the simulation using ros.
